### The Problem Section

**Headline:** Business is booming, but where to from here?

**Subheadline:** Growth is exciting - but it brings new challenges. As demand increases, the systems and tools that worked before can start to fall behind. Here's what that often looks like:

**List of Issues:**
- Customer demand is growing, but your systems aren’t keeping up with the load
- Every new product or team change adds complexity to your setup
- Technical debt is building, and you're not sure what to fix first
- You're unsure which tools, platforms, or architecture to bet on next
- You have more data than ever - but no clear way to use it to make decisions
- Dashboards, reports, and tools are inconsistent - or missing altogether

### Introduction Section

**Heading:**
Building large-scale systems at every level for over a decade

**Introduction:**
Hi, I'm **Hendrik Crause**. For the past 10+ years, I’ve worked on systems that:

- Scrape and structure web-scale data
- Process billions of records every day
- Run complex analytics across diverse datasets
- Pre-process data for machine learning pipelines
- Support production-grade web applications

Whether it’s scaling infrastructure, building data pipelines, or turning raw data into business insight - I’ve likely solved something similar before.

I started **HC Scaling Solutions** to help fast-moving startups build a solid foundation for growth. The goal is simple: apply deep technical experience to make sure your business is ready for what’s next - without the growing pains.

### FAQ Section

- **What kind of businesses do you work with?**  
  I work with fast-growing startups and mid-sized companies that are dealing with data scaling challenges. This includes e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, and any business where data volume and complexity are increasing rapidly.

- **What happens during the first call?**  
  The discovery call is a no-obligation conversation where we discuss your current challenges, goals, and technical setup. I'll ask about your data infrastructure, pain points, and growth plans to create a tailored scaling strategy.

- **How do I know if I need help with scaling?**  
  If you're experiencing slow query times, inconsistent data, frequent system crashes under load, or if you're unsure how to handle increasing data volumes, it's time to consider scaling assistance.

- **Do you work with existing systems or only new builds?**  
  I work with both! I can optimize and scale existing systems or design and build new ones from scratch. Many projects involve enhancing current infrastructure rather than complete rebuilds.

- **What kinds of problems can you help solve?**  
  I help solve issues like slow data processing, unreliable pipelines, poor data quality, inefficient storage, lack of real-time insights, and systems that can't handle growth.

- **What's your typical process like?**  
  We start with discovery, then move to planning and design, followed by implementation and testing. I provide regular updates and ensure everything works smoothly before handover.

- **How long does a typical project take?**  
  Projects vary widely - from 2-4 weeks for smaller optimizations to 3-6 months for complex system rebuilds. I'll give you a specific timeline during our discovery call.

- **Can you work with my in-house dev team?**  
  Absolutely! I can collaborate with your existing team, provide guidance, or handle the entire project. Many clients prefer a hybrid approach where I lead while training their developers.
